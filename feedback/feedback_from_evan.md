**Feedback For README.md**

*Strengths*
- Your README has clear and detailed instructions for how to use the application, from set-up to operation.

- The sections are well organised and is easy to navigate

*Areas for improvement*
- Start with a brief, engaging summary that emphasises the application's main benefit, such as, "The Bar Reference Application simplifies managing and creating bar menus while allowing users to invent and document custom cocktails."

- Explain why listing built-in dependencies matters, such as, "Since the application only uses built-in packages, no additional installations are needed, making setup simpler."

- Example data scenarios might be helpful as well. Like how would a user add a beer or create a mix?

- Possibly a section on error handling. Like how errors are handled within the app.

- Briefly explain what each technical features do in plain language, e.g., "The mkdir() method creates a new folder for storing your bar's data."


Other then that it is really solid in its layout and foundation. A few things to improve on in terms of terminology and making the document more accessible for people that have different levels of technical skills
