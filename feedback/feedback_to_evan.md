**Feedback for DEV1002 Assignment 3 README.md:**

*Strengths*
- Very well structured document, easy to navigate and read.

- Description of the application leaves nothing to be confused about in terms of its function.

- Dependencies installation is easy to follow.

- Your Explanation of Chosen Database section and Licensing and Legal/Ethical impacts section are both well-structured.

*Areas for improvement*
- When describing the first run of the application, you don't describe the necessity to create the database in postgreSQL or the steps to use the cli commands to create the tables.

- Linked to that, is that the user would need to define their own DATABASE_URI, which would require instruction.

- Only other nitpick is that you have your Required Packages section separate from the instructions to install said packages.
